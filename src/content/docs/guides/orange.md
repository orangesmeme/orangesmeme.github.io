## What is Orange?

Orange is a mineable meme coin on Algorand. It was created by [@grzracz](https://x.com/grzracz) and is an open source, community-driven project. As originally stated by the author:

> Orange (ticker: ORA) is a "mineable" Algorand Standard Asset fully managed by an open-source smart contract. It operates similarly to Bitcoin (ticker: BTC), where multiple parties can compete to earn a coin in a decentralized trustless manner.
>
> The mining mechanism of ORA is based on transaction fees: whenever any account submits a "mine" (juice) application transaction, the fee paid to the Algorand protocol is saved in the contract. The miner with the total highest amount of fees paid in total that has submitted a "mine" transaction within a given period is rewarded & coins are sent automatically after the next period of juicing, while their (and only their) total amount of fees paid is reset to zero.
>
> Fee effort is cumulative: only the winner has his effort reduced - even slow juicers eventually will reach the top, no matter which round.
>
> This means that ORA functions both as a store of value & as a way to reward users increasing the Algorand network throughput.

## Tokenomics

Like Bitcoin, each ORA since the start was produced through mining. ORA is produced once every five rounds (blocks). The amount produced is determined by the halving schedule. 

* The first halving produced 1,000,000 ORA at ~1.05 ORA per 5-round period.. 
* The second halving produces 500,000 ORA at ~.52 ORA per 5-round period.
* The third halving produces 250,000 ORA at ~.26 ORA per 5-round period.
* And so on... 

The total supply of ORA is capped at 4,000,000 ORA and will take roughly 15 years for all ORA to be produced. 

## On Mining

Mining ORA has many similarities to mining Bitcoin, but it also has unique differences that make it highly efficient and suitable to addressing economic issues related to Proof-of-Stake blockchains.
